                <h2>What is the give command useful for?</h2>
                <p>The give command is used to give the player items, and in more advanced command usage is used to obtain custom items that can only be given with commands. 
                This is very usful in both the making of creations that need a custom item and just playing around. One example would be using it the obtain a sword with sharpness 100. 
                Another use of /give would be to get a carrot on a stick with a custom NBT tag that when used, would increase a scoreboard and activate something.</p>
