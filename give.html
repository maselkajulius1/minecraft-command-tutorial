        <h1>/Give Command Explanation</h1>

        <div class="container-1">
            <div class="box-1">
                <h2>What is the give command useful for?</h2>
                <p>The give command is used to give the player items, and in more advanced command usage is used to obtain custom items that can only be given with commands. 
                This is very usful in both the making of creations that need a custom item and just playing around. One example would be using it the obtain a sword with sharpness 100. 
                Another use of /give would be to get a carrot on a stick with a custom NBT tag that when used, would increase a scoreboard and activate something.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-2">
                <h2>Basics of /Give</h2>
                <p>A give command is written where the target is written first(@a, @p, ect.), then the item(and NBT data), and then the amount of items given. For example,
                "/give @p minecraft:netherite_axe 1". The amount of items given is not needed(the default is 1). Also, unless you are giving a modded item, you dont need
                to specify where the item is from so you could also write the command as "/give @p netherite_axe".</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-3">
                <h2>Basic NBT data</h2>
                <p>The most important NBT data tags to know for /give are enchantments, unbreakable, and custom tags. NBT tags are written where after you put
                in the item you want to give, you write the tags in curly brackets. Other tags that you should probably use mcstacker.net to use are hide tags, 
                modifiers, can destroy, can place on, name, and lore.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-4">
                <h2>Sharpness NBT tag</h2>
                <p>To write a enchantment tag, you first put "Enchatments:", then put a set of square
                brackets, and within the sqaure brackets put a set of curly bracket for each enchantment, with a coma in between each set of brackets. Inside
                The brackets you put the enchantment id(sharpness, protection, ect.) and then the level.An example would be "/give @p diamond sword{Enchantments:
                [{id:sharpness,lvl:2},{id:unbreaking,lvl:5}]} 1". This gives a diamond sword with sharpness 2 and unbreaking 5.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-5">
                <h2>Unbreakable and Custom NBT tags</h2>
                <p>The unbreakable tag is really is really simple. You just have to put "ubreakable:1b" in you data. For example, "/give @p diamond_sword
                {unbreakable:1b} 1". Combining that with enchantments would look like "/give @p diamond_sword{Enchantments:[{id:sharpness,lvl:5}],unbreakable:1b}. 
                Custom tags are similar but instead of writting "unbreakable:1b" you write whatever the name of your tag is(it can't be the name name of an existing tag).
                An example of that is "/give @p carrot_on_a_stick{exploding:1b} 1".</p>
